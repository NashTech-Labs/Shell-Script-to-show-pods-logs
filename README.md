# Short Description about this template
This shell script helps to fetch all namespaces in a cluster and list all pods inside the particular namespace and check the logs of the pods.

Here we created a user interactive user that can enter the particular namespace so that the user can see all pods inside the namespace and fetch the logs after all the logs are stored in a text file with the naming convention namespace, pod name with date and time.


# Steps for Execution 
1. chmod +x scanning_script.sh
2. ./scanning_script.sh
